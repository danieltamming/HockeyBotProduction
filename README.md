# HockeyBotProduction
Code that runs HockeyBot, a Facebook Messenger chatbot, on a Heroku server. 

Sentence completion: HockeyBot assumes that the words it receives from the user are the beginning of an NHL player or coach's interview. It responds with several sentences that follow the input words, as if it were spoken by a generic player/coach.

HockeyBot is powered by an LSTM that was trained on NHL interview transcripts scraped from [ASAP Sports](http://www.asapsports.com/). 

Follow this Facebook Messenger [link](m.me/102447081166159) to interact with the bot.
